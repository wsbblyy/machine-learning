# machine-learning 18-11-2017

After a day of research, finding that learning the genetic algorithm 
is a very interesting way to start.
There are tons of insteresting self-evolution games on youtube,
I'd really like to get started by building one of those games :)

1. After looking a quite few tutorials, I found this website http://boxcar2d.com,
It's a very interesting little webgame, that uses the genetic algorithm to evolute 
cars that can get better score of the game. The website has a description
and implementation of the game, however, read text is not for me, let's see if
I can find something ealse to look up, if not, I probably have to come back
and study it XD. It's funny to look at the process of those cars evolution tho.

2. Find the source code of boxcar2d on github, see if it helps.

3. NO! Too much code, won't help unless you can really look into those code.
